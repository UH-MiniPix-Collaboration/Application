\section{In-Flight Failure Contingency Plan}
\label{sec:Failure}
If for some reason the sampling system fails, commands can be uplinked to the control system that allow for subsystem resets. If the temperature falls below component operating conditions, the heater associated to that particular subsystem will automatically turn on until operating conditions are restored and the system is operational. If downlinked data shows extreme overheating or any sort of abnormality that could result in damage to HASP or other payloads, we will shut down all systems through the discrete command provided by HASP.
